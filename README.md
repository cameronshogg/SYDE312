### Abstract:

This report details an attempt to construct a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in Melbourne based on several factors, including number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and distance from downtown. Initial analysis and pre-processing were completed in Python, to select important features and remove null rows from the dataset. An Ordinary Least Squares model was computed in Matlab using QR Decomposition, and a Ridge Regression model was fit using the Normal Equations. The Ridge Regression model performed better, but both models had high Root-Mean-Square Error, meaning that neither predicted new observations well.
