## Linear Regression to Predict Housing Prices in Melbourne, with OLS and L2 Regularization
### Abstract:

This report details an attempt to construct a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict housing prices in Melbourne based on several factors, including number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and distance of the property from the downtown core. Initial pre-processing was completed in Python to select important features and remove null rows from the dataset. An Ordinary Least Squares model was then computed in Matlab using QR Decomposition, and a Ridge Regression model was fit using the Normal Equations. The Ridge Regression model performed better, but both models had high Root-Mean-Square Error, meaning that neither predicted new observations well.
